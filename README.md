👋 Hi, I’m Smart Anwana

CRM Manager | IT Support Specialist

I help businesses design, set up, and maintain clean, reliable CRM systems that actually get used — not overcomplicated tools that break after setup.

I specialize in building CRMs that are easy to use, scalable, and maintainable, with clear workflows and automation that support real business operations.
