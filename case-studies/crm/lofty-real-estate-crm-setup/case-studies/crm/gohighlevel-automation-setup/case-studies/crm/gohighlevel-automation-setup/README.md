## Project Overview

**Role:** CRM Manager & IT Support Specialist  
**Platform:** GoHighLevel  
**Industry:** Real Estate

## The Problem

Before the setup, the CRM environment was fragmented and underutilized:

- No automation in place
- Follow-ups were manual and inconsistent
- Leads were being missed
- No defined pipelines
- Poor SMS and email delivery
- Funnels were not connected properly
- No calendar booking flow
- CRM felt too complex to use daily
- Contacts were not imported or mapped correctly
- No workflows existed
- Email subdomain was not configured for proper delivery
- Email verification was not set up

These issues resulted in lost opportunities, slow response times, and low confidence in the CRM system.

## Goals

The CRM needed to become a reliable, centralized system that supported daily operations and long-term nurturing. Key goals included:

- Automated lead follow-up
- Centralized CRM for all leads
- Email and SMS campaign setup
- Simple, clear pipelines
- Appointment booking and calendar integration
- Long-term lead nurturing
- Easy daily usability
- Proper email delivery using a dedicated subdomain
- Smooth lead transfer from MyRealPage into GoHighLevel using Zapier and LeadConnector

## My Approach

The focus was on simplifying the system while ensuring strong automation and reliability. Instead of overbuilding, the setup emphasized:

- Clear workflows
- Proper data flow
- Strong deliverability
- Minimal manual intervention

Each component was designed to work together seamlessly so the client could trust the system and use it consistently.
