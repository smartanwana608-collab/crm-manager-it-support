# Lofty CRM Setup – Real Estate

## Project Overview

**Role:** CRM Manager & IT Support Specialist  
**Platform:** Lofty  
**Industry:** Real Estate  
**Project Type:** Real client (anonymized)  

This project involved setting up, fixing, and optimizing a real estate CRM to support daily lead management, follow-up, marketing, and long-term nurturing. The goal was to create a system that was simple to use, reliable, and easy to maintain.

## The Problem

Before the setup, the CRM environment had multiple issues that made it difficult for agents to use effectively:

- CRM was not properly configured
- No clear buyer vs seller workflow
- No follow-up system or campaigns
- No automation in place
- Leads were coming in but not being followed up
- IDX was not properly integrated
- Chatbot was not functioning correctly
- Website was not customized or fully set up
- Blog content was not written or published
- SEO basics were missing or incomplete

As a result, leads were being missed, follow-ups were inconsistent, and the CRM was not being used daily.

## Goals

The CRM needed to support the full real estate workflow while remaining simple and practical. The key goals were:

- Clear buyer and seller pipelines
- Automated follow-up and long-term nurturing
- Proper IDX integration and lead confirmation
- Fully set up and customized website
- Custom domain integration, including subdomain for email delivery
- Campaign setup for buyers and sellers
- Use of custom code where drag-and-drop limitations existed
- SEO setup for website pages and blog posts
- Reliable integrations using Zapier
- A system that agents would actually use daily

## My Approach

I focused on building a CRM that matched how real estate agents actually work day-to-day. Instead of adding unnecessary complexity, I prioritized clarity, automation, and maintainability.

Each part of the system was designed to:
- Reduce manual work
- Improve response time
- Make lead status immediately visible
- Support long-term relationship building
