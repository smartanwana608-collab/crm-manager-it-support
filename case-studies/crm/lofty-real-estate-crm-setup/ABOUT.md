# About / Positioning

I am a CRM Manager with a strong IT support background, specializing in building, fixing, and maintaining systems that teams actually use.

My work focuses on clarity, reliability, and long-term usability — not overengineering or unnecessary complexity.

I primarily support:
- Real estate agents and brokerages
- Small businesses and startups
- Coaches, consultants, and service-based professionals
- Founders and executives who need systems that work without constant oversight

## How I Work

I approach every project from a systems perspective.

Before building anything, I focus on:
- Understanding how leads, data, and people should move
- Identifying what is broken, missing, or creating friction
- Designing workflows that are simple, maintainable, and scalable

My goal is always the same:
**reduce manual work, improve follow-up consistency, and make the system easy to manage long-term.**
